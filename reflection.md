- Which methods did you decide to `overload`, and why?

    House: I overloaded the moveIn and moveOut methods so that it can take 2 parameters at the same time. I did this because some residents have emotional support pets with them when they move in. 

    Cafe: I overloaded the sellCoffee and restock so that it can have doubles too.

    Library: I overloaded the addTitle and removeTitle so that it can add/remove subtitles along with titles too. 


- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

    Overriding the methods and adjusting the parameters for each class was the part I struggled. Also, adding buildings to the map was confusing.
